## Compatible Extras

This UserScript is compatible
with [Textarea Reducer Stacks Controller](https://github.com/HenryEcker/SO-UserScripts/blob/main/RegisterTextareaReducer.user.js) ([install](https://github.com/HenryEcker/SO-UserScripts/raw/main/RegisterTextareaReducer.user.js)).
This is an optional add-on which will
replace text as you type to minimise the number of characters in the textarea. Some examples of supported
reductions are converting the
full answer URL to `/a/{answerId}` and converting comment URLs to `/posts/comments/{commentId}`.
